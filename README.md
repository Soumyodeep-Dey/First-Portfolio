# Portfolio Webpage

This is a personal portfolio webpage developed by me using only HTML and CSS. The project showcases my journey and learning process as I explore the foundational elements of web development.

## What I've Learned

### 1. Importance of Learning the Basics
Understanding the core concepts of HTML and CSS is crucial for building a strong foundation. Mastery of these basics enables one to undertake more complex projects with confidence and efficiency.

### 2. Problem-Solving and Persistence
Throughout this journey, I encountered various challenges. Here's what I learned about tackling them:
- **Patience and Persistence:** When faced with problems, take the time to understand and address them.
- **Utilizing Resources:** If the solution isn't immediately apparent, seek out resources on the internet. There’s a wealth of information available to help troubleshoot and resolve issues.

### 3. Continuous Learning and Improvement
Even when solutions are elusive, it’s important not to give up on coding. With continued practice and experience, the ability to identify and resolve issues becomes more intuitive. Each challenge provides an opportunity for growth and learning.

## Project Code
As promised, I have uploaded the code for this project. It serves as a testament to my learning journey and a resource for others who may benefit from seeing the practical application of HTML and CSS fundamentals.
